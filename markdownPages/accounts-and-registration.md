# Help: Accounts and Registration

## Account Registration

Mouse Create is currently only available to Mouse member sites. If you are not a Mouse Member [learn more about joining the Mouse learning network](https://mouse.org/join) on mouse.org.

### First, find your Educator Code

Each Mouse location (typically a school or other youth-serving organization) receives a unique Educator Code by email when they join or renew Mouse membership. For the protection of our students, adults will not be able to join Mouse Create without a valid Educator Code. This code upgrades your user and gives you special access to create a group for your students to join and to manage their work. Do NOT give the Educator Code to youth, but you should share the code with other adult educators at your location so they can lead projects with their students on Mouse Create.

If you are a Mouse member site, but have not received your site’s Educator Code, please email help@mouse.org with your name, and the name of your school or organization and we will get back to you ASAP.

6.  Fill out the form, choosing a username and password and submit.
7.  After logging in, you must upgrade your account to “Become an Educator". Enter your Educator Code. You only need to do this once.

1.  Register Educator account
2.  Submit Educator Code on the “Become an Educator" page
3.  Submit Group Code on the “Join a Group" page

### Troubleshooting Registration Issues

If you or your students are having difficulty registering your accounts or if the Register button doesn’t seem to work. Please go through these steps before reaching out to Mouse for support:

1.  Confirm that each field in the registration form has been completed correctly, and that there are no error messages.
2.  Confirm that the Terms of Service checkbox “Please mark that you have read and agree to the terms here" has been checked
3.  Confirm that the “I am not a robot" Captcha is checked. Note: some users will be asked to complete an image quiz to confirm that they are not a spam-bot. This quiz can sometimes be difficult to complete. If it fails the first time, you will get a new quiz if you try again.

If there are no missing fields, the “I am not a robot" box has a green checkmark, and the registration form is still not submitting:

1.  Try using a different internet browser. Mouse Create works best in Google Chrome. Mouse Create does not support older versions of Internet Explorer or Firefox.
2.  Check that you are running the most updated version of your browser. If not, please upgrade.
3.  Run any pending updates for your Operating System.
4.  Check that you are connected to the internet correctly.

If you still can not create accounts, contact help@mouse.org. Please share these details about your circumstances: What version of your browser are you using? What operating system are you using? At what point in the process are you receiving an error? Do any error messages appear? Share a screenshot of the problem if possible.

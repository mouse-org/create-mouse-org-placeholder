  <h1>Updates</h1>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <h3>11/21/16</h3>
      <p>Bug Fix: Fixed a bug on the registration form where you wouldn't receive an error message if you entered a phone number incorrectly. This made it seem like the form was broken because the register button didn't seem to work.  Now, the phone number field only allows numbers and gives an error if you don't fill it in completely.</p>

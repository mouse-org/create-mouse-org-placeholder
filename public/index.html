      <p>We have a big announcement! In the Fall, all of the activities, projects, resources and community that currently live on <a href="http://mousesquad.org/">mousesquad.org</a> will be making a move! We are in the middle of packing up, dusting off and making a lot of updates and will be starting fresh with a new website here at <a href="http://create.mouse.org/">create.mouse.org.</a></p> 
      <p>Mousesquad.org will stay up during the summer and into the fall while all Mouse sites start to transition to create.mouse.org.  </p>
      <p>Please email us at <a href="mailto:create@mouse.org?Subject=Website%20Transition">create@mouse.org</a> with any questions about the transition. We will be making more announcements soon about what to expect! </p>

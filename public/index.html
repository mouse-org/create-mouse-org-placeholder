        <p>Summer is a great time to start new projects, learn new skills or experiment with new techniques! What technology are you creating with this summer? What projects are you excited to work on?</p>

        <p>Mouse wants to see the exciting work you are doing, whether itâ€™s a simple web remix, a complex electronics project, or a fun game.</p>

        <p>Need an idea? Try out the <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/68360196/"">Wheels of Spinvention</a> for a fun prompt. Write a few sentences about your project and share a link with the Mouse network by emailing <a href="mailto:create@mouse.org">create@mouse.org</a> or using #summerwithpurpose and tagging @mouse_org in your favorite social media tool.</p>

        <p>We have a big announcement! In the Fall, all of the activities, projects, resources, and community that currently live on <a href="http://mousesquad.org/">mousesquad.org</a> will be making a move! We are in the middle of packing up, dusting off and making a lot of updates and will be starting fresh with a new website here at <a href="http://create.mouse.org/">create.mouse.org</a>.</p> 
        <p>Mousesquad.org will stay up during the summer and into the fall while all Mouse sites start to transition to create.mouse.org.  </p>
        <p>Please email us at <a href="mailto:create@mouse.org">create@mouse.org</a> with any questions about the transition. We will be making more announcements soon about what to expect! </p>

  <h1>Help: Frequently Asked Questions:</h1>
  <h3>What is Mouse Create?</h3>
  <p>Mouse Create is an online learning platform for youth to create technology with purpose. Our hands-on, interactive projects include everything from web literacy and fixer skills, to innovative content areas, like circuitry, game design, coding, and green technology.</p>

  <h3>What is Mouse Create? What happened to mousesquad.org?</h3>
  <p>In early September, Mouse moved all of our curriculum to <a href="https://create.mouse.org">Mouse Create</a>, our new learning platform which will replace mousesquad.org. Mouse Create has 100+ projects in 20+ competency areas. We are also partnering with <a href="https://credly.com">Credly</a> to issue new digital badges for each competency area.</p>

  <h3>What is a project?</h3>
  <p>Projects on Mouse Create have a step-by-step interface similar to the specialist activities on mousesquad.org. Sixty percent of the projects on Mouse Create are activities from our existing curriculum that have been updated for both this new step-by-step format and to keep current with the latest technology and digital tools. The other 40% of the projects on Mouse Create are completely new for the 2016 - 2017 school year and will cover more up-to-date technology competencies in areas like software and networking, along with introducing curriculum on 2D Design, 3D Design and Human Centered Design.</p>

  <h3>How do I use my Educator Codes and my Group Code?</h3>
  <p>Every Mouse member site will be emailed an Educator Code that you can share with all educators at your site to create accounts.  Each Educator will be able to create Groups for each of their classes, clubs, or teams, or join other Groups to help other Educators run Mouse projects. Each Group will have a unique Group code that Educators can use to add Learners to their groups.</p>

  <h3>How do I use my Group's Playlist?</h3>
  <p>Each Group on Mouse Create will have a customizable Playlist of projects created by the Educators in the group. Learners on Mouse Create will be able to work through the playlist throughout the year, or do one-off projects on their own or in small groups.  Educators and Learners can filter projects through tags about competency areas, time limits and skills.</p>

  <h3>How will youth document their work on Mouse Create?</h3>
  <p>Student evidence on Mouse Create is submitted through “Project Work". Like blog posts on mousesquad.org, these can be text-based reflections,uploaded images, or attachments.</p>

  <h3>Do youth have to upload work on every step in the “Show Your Work" area?</h3>
  <p>No, youth are only required to upload work on steps where there is a prompt displayed just below the “Show Your Work" banner. The Show Your Work buttons are available on every step so that youth can add work they have done anywhere during the process of completing their project.</p>

  <h3>How do I transition youth from Mousesquad.org?</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Mousesquad.org will be available through the Fall of 2016 to help sites transition to Mouse Create.</li>
    <li>You and the learners at your site will need to create new accounts for Mouse Create. Because of technical changes to accounts on Mouse Create, and updated curriculum, neither existing user accounts nor old badges from mousesquad.org will transfer to Mouse Create. Mouse will be supporting all sites through the Fall in making new accounts on Mouse Create, and learning to use the new platform.</li>
    <li>We will also be shutting down our CaseTracker tool from mousesquad.org. We have new projects which are part of our Fixing and Troubleshooting Badge that will help sites set up new, more professional ticket tracking systems.  You can export a CSV spreadsheet of all your cases from within CaseTracker as a backup.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Will any info (Accounts, Badges, Blog Posts . . .) transfer from mousesquad.org?</h3>
  <p>No: because of technical changes to accounts on Mouse Create, updated curriculum, and the partnership with Credly, neither existing user accounts nor old badges from mousesquad.org will transfer to Mouse Create. Mouse will be supporting all sites through the Fall in making new accounts on Mouse Create, and learning to use the new platform.</p>

  <h3>Where is Casetracker?</h3>
  <p>There is no Casetracker tool on Mouse Create. We recommend free professional Ticket Tracking tools in the project called “Setting Up a Ticket Tracking System" in the Fixer course.</p>

  <h3>How do educators train youth to use Mouse Create? Are there activities that introduce the platform?</h3>
  <p>Lead the Mouse Create Scavenger Hunt project to get users familiar with the features of the platform.</p>

  <h3>How are Badges changing?</h3>
  <p>Mouse has partnered with <a href="https://credly.com">Credly.com</a> to offer digital credentials that can be shared with parents, teachers, and friends on social networks, college applications or on resumes.  Mouse Educators will be responsible for reviewing and giving feedback on each student’s project work and evidence before issuing badges.  As you place projects and courses in your group playlist, you will see which digital badges your group will be eligible for.  Users must be 13 or older to create a Credly account and earn digital badges. </p> 

  <h3>My Educator or Group Code didn’t work, am I not registered?</h3>
  <p>Educator Codes do not work with youth accounts. Make sure you did not accidentally register a youth account.</p>

  <p>The Educator Code that you received is not your password to the site. You (and any other educators at your site) should register for a Mouse Create account using the Register link on the homepage or going to <a href="https://create.mouse.org/register">https://create.mouse.org/register</a>.  You will choose a username and password there.</p>

  <p>Once you have created an account you will enter your Educator Code on the Dashboard page, which will give you permission to create Groups on the site.

  <p>Any educators who will be working with students should follow the same procedure using the same Educator Code. Educators who create Groups will get another unique Group Code to share with their students so that the students can join the Group.</p>

  <h3>If I created my Credly account using Facebook or LinkedIn how do I connect my Mouse Create account?</h3>
  <p>You can login to Credly using either Facebook or LinkedIn, then edit your Credly profile to add an email address and a password. You will now be able login to Credly through Mouse Create using the new email and password.</p>

  <h3>How do I find my Group’s playlist? How can I see which students are in my Group?</h3>
  <p>The projects playlist is available on your Group page, this way you can have a different playlist for each Group. You can access your Group page by clicking on your Group name in the black header at the top of the page.</p>

  <h3>Can I edit my Group’s playlist?</h3>
  <p>You can change the order of the projects in your Group’s playlist by clicking on the “Manage" link to the right of the word “Playlist" on your Group page.</p>

    <p>Mouse Create is currently only available to Mouse member sites. If you are not a Mouse Member <a href="https://mouse.org/join" target="_blank">learn more about joining the Mouse learning network</a> on mouse.org.<br></p>
    <p><strong>Educator Code</strong></p>

    <p>Adults&nbsp;must enter your site's&nbsp;Educator Code (from Mouse) after creating your new educator account. &nbsp;This code upgrades your user and gives you special access&nbsp;to create a group for your students to join and to manage their work. <strong>Do NOT&nbsp;give the educator code to a student.&nbsp;</strong>Students will join after you register and setup your group, instructions below.</p>

    <ul><li>If you are a Mouse member site, but have not received your site’s Educator Code, check your email spam filter for an email with the subject “Your Educator Code for Mouse Create”.&nbsp;</li><li>If you did not receive the email, reach out to <a href="mailto:help@mouse.org">help@mouse.org</a> with your name, and the name of your school or organization and we will get back to you ASAP.</li></ul>

    <ol><li><p>Youth accounts are added the same way as Educator accounts, from create.mouse.org/register. Youth will choose “Yes” to the first question, “Are you a student in grades K - 12”.<br></p></li><li><p>After Youth have created their new accounts and logged in, share with them the Group Code listed on your Dashboard or at the top of your Group page. &nbsp;They must enter your Group Code in order to join your group and to get access to projects. </p></li><li><p>Do not share your Educator Code with youth. </p></li></ol>
    <p>If you have other adult educators at your site that you would like to join your group, they can do so by entering first your Educator Code (to give them educator status), then your Group Code (to join your site).</p>

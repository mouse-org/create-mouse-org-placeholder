  <h1>Help: Accounts and Registration</h1>
  <h2>Account Registration</h2>
  <p>Mouse Create is currently only available to Mouse member sites. If you are not a Mouse Member <a href="https://mouse.org/join">learn more about joining the Mouse learning network</a> on mouse.org.</p>
  <h3>About Educator Codes</h3>
  <p>To get started on Mouse Create, adults must enter your site's Educator Code (provided by Mouse) after creating a new educator account.  This code upgrades your user and gives you special access to create a group for your students to join and to manage their work. Do NOT give the educator code to youth. Students will join with a different code after you register and setup your group.</p>

  <p>If you are a Mouse member site, but have not received your site’s Educator Code, check your email spam filter for an email with the subject “Your Educator Code for Mouse Create".</p> 

  <p>If you did not receive an email, reach out to help@mouse.org with your name, and the name of your school or organization and we will get back to you ASAP.</p>
  <h3>How to register Educator accounts</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>Go to Mouse Create at https://create.mouse.org</li>
    <li>Click on Register</li>
    <li>“Are you a student in grades K-12?": No</li>
    <li>“Do you have an Educator code?": Yes</li>
    <li>If your site is a public or private school, find it in the database of schools. Otherwise choose “An organization or institution that is not a school" from the dropdown.</li>
    <li>Fill out the form, choosing a username and password and submit.</li>
    <li>After logging in, you will be taken to your Dashboard where you’ll enter your Educator Code, you only need to do this once.</li>
  </ol>
  <h3>How to register Youth accounts</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>Go to Mouse Create at https://create.mouse.org</li>
    <li>Click on Register</li>
    <li>“Are you a student in grades K-12?": Yes</li>
    <li>Youth should find the school that they attend. If the site where they participate in Mouse is not their school, this will not be the site where they participate in Mouse. Youth who select a school that is not the site where they participate in Mouse during registration will still be able to join that site’s groups.</li>
    <li>After Youth have created their new accounts, share the Group Code listed on your Dashboard or at the top of your Group page with them.  They must enter your Group Code in order to join your group and to get access to projects.</li>
    <li>Do not share your Educator Code with youth.</li>
  </ol>

  <ol>
    <li>Register Educator account</li>
    <li>Submit Educator Code on Dashboard</li>

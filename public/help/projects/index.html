      Preparing to Facilitate a Project: 
    </h3>
    
    <ul><li><p>Projects that require facilitation are often tagged “With a Group” &mdash; meaning this project can not be done by a student on their own. </p></li><li><p>To facilitate a project on Mouse Create, first open it by clicking on the project from the Project Finder or within your Group’s Playlist. &nbsp;</p></li><li><p>Before leading, read through the project’s Background. </p></li><li><p>In the steps menu to the right of the project, at the bottom, is the Background information about the project. &nbsp;Here you will find a list of outcomes, materials, and instructions on how to prep the activity. &nbsp;You will also find a link to the project’s standards alignment, debrief/reflection questions and any suggested prerequisite or follow-up projects. </p></li><li>We recommend going through each of the project’s steps on your own before leading with youth. </li></ul>

    <ul><li><p>Students, or small groups of students, can either follow along step-by-step on their own devices or you could display the steps on a projector or smartboard for the whole group. &nbsp;</p></li><li><p>Show your Work: On each step, there is a “Show your Work” area at the bottom. &nbsp;This area often has required reflection questions, or a request to document their work with an image or text. &nbsp;</p></li><li><p>Review and Submit: At the end of each project, students must review and submit their work to receive credit for having completed the project. &nbsp;</p></li><li><p>Add Collaborators: If students are working in teams, or as a whole group, they can tag other users in your group as “collaborators” before submitting the project. This will give those users credit for having completed the project as well. </p></li><li><p>Finished projects will be submitted for review by the group educator- you can find these on your group page at the bottom, in an area called “Project Review”. &nbsp;</p></li><li>Note: students in multiple groups need to make sure the correct group is active at the top of the page before starting a project. </li></ul>

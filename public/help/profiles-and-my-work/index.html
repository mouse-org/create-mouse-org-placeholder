    <h3>Editing a Student’s Profile</h3>
    <p>Educators can also edit the profile of all students within their group/s, as needed.  For instance, if a student has forgotten their password, their educator can change it for them.</p>

    <ul>
    <li>To find your student’s profile page, click on their username in the Members area of your Group page.</li>
    <li>Click the “Edit Account Settings” link on the Profile page.</li>

    </ul>

    <h3>The “My Work” Page</h3>
    <p>The “My Work” page is a part of the Profile where you can view, organize and export the work you have submitted on Mouse Create.  Students could create a category for projects to add to their digital portfolio, projects to include on a college application, projects related to games or coding or whichever theme they choose.  Currently, the “My Work” page is private and only viewable by the user.  Educators can not see or edit their students’ “My Work” area. Watch this screencast to see how it works:</p>

    <h3>Creating Custom Categories on the “My Work” Page</h3>

  <p>  Custom Categories can be used to organize your work into themes that match your goals.  Once you have added work to a category, you can export all of the work in that category to save or share it off of Mouse Create.</p>

    <ul>
    <li>To get to “My Work”, click on the Profile icon in the top menu, then select the “My Work” tab.</li>
    <li>In the “Categories” area, click the “Add New Category” button.</li>
    <li>Type your category and “Save”.</li>
    <li>You can have as many custom categories as you like, and you can put your work into multiple categories.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Adding work to your Custom Categories</h3>
<ul>
    <li>In the “My Work” tab of your Profile, click to open one of your project work submissions in the “Evidence: All” area.</li>
    <li>Go to the “Manage” tab.  Note: you will only see the Manage tab if you are viewing your own work, or work that you were added as a collaborator.</li>
    <li>From the Manage area, under “Custom Categories”, use the drop down menu to select a custom category.  It will immediately add the work to the category you selected.</li>
    <li>You can add the work to as many categories as you like.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Removing work from a Category</h3>

    <ul>
    <li>Go to the “Manage” tab of your work submission.  Note: you will only see the Manage tab if you are viewing your own work, or work that you were added as a collaborator.</li>
    <li>From the Manage area, under “Custom Categories”, click the “X” next to the category you would like to remove. It will immediately remove the work from the category you selected.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Exporting work from a Category</h3>

<ul>
    <li>In the “Custom Categories” area of your “My Work” page, select the category you would like to export.</li>
    <li>Click the “Export” link. </li>
    <li>The work within that category will be downloaded to your device as a .zip file.  Each image, text or file you added to your work will be saved in that .zip, organized by your username (or the username of the person who created the work) and the name of the project. </li>
    <li>Note: if your category includes many projects, or projects with very large files, the .zip file may take longer to appear.  Do NOT click the export button more than once, it will cause an error. </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Deleting or Editing a Category</h3>

    <li>In the “Custom Categories” area of your “My Work” page, select the category you would like to delete or edit.</li>

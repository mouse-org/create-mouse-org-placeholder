    <p>After creating a new educator account, and entering your <a href="https://tools.mouse.org/help/accounts-and-registration/">Educator Code</a>, you will have 2 choices to gain full access to the site, Join a Group or Create a Group:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Scroll down the page to fill in the "Create a Group" form.</li>
      <li>Name your Group, review, check the Permission Agreement, and click the button to create your first group!</li>
      <li>The playlist on your Group page will be empty until you add projects.</li>
    </ol>
    <p><strong>Joining an Existing Group:</strong> If you do not want to start your own group, you can also join an existing group that was created by a different Mouse educator.  You will need that group’s Group Code to join.  The educator within the group you wish to join can find the Group Code underneath the group’s name on the group page.  Joining any group as an educator will give you full access to manage the group’s playlist and students.</p>

    <h3>Managing Notifications</h3>

    <video controls=""><source src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/create-production/content/Educatorcourse/screencast_notifications.mp4" type="video/mp4">Your browser does not support HTML5.</video>

    <ul>
    <li>The Notifications area is accessed through the lightning bolt button in the top navigation of Mouse Create.</li>
    <li>If you have new notifications since the last time you clicked into the Notifications area, you will see a number in a red circle on the lightning bolt. This number clears when you click into the area.</li>
    <li>You’ll receive notifications for many different events on Mouse Create (see below for a list). </li>
    <li>The left side of the notification has the avatar image of the user who prompted the notification.  If the speech box around the avatar is gray, the notification is from a student.  If it is green, the notification is from an educator.</li>
    <li>To view a notification, click it. This will mark the notification as “read” and it will turn light gray.</li>
    <li>Click the “see only unread” link at the top to show just the notifications that you haven’t already clicked to view.</li>
    <li>If a new notification comes in while you are in the Notifications area, refresh the page in your browser to view it, or click to a different area of the site and return.</li>
    </ul>

Help: Groups — Playlist
=======================

### About the Playlist

The playlist is a set of projects chosen by a group’s educator or educators that is saved on the group page. Mouse recommends using the playlist feature to help students find projects, and complete them in a specific order.

### Add Projects and Courses to your Group’s Playlist (Educators only)

1.  Click on "Projects" at the top of the page (you will not see this until you have created or joined a Group).
2.  Browse all of the Projects, or use the Project Finder tags on the left hand side of the page to filter projects according to their Course, Skill area, or Setting (time and size of group). On some smaller devices the Project Finder tags will not be visible, click “Fiter Projects" at the top of the list to expand the list.
3.  When you find a project you’d like to add to your group’s playlist, click "Add to Group".
4.  *   You’ll be prompted to choose which group you’d like to add the project to. Check your group’s box. You can add the project to multiple groups by checking multiple boxes.
    *   If the project is part of a course (most projects are) you will also have the option to add the whole course to your group’s playlist. If you want to add the whole course check the box next to “Add the entire course to this group?"
    *   If you add the whole course to your playlist they will appear in the recommended course order (on the project page they appear in alphabetical order, even when filtered).
    *   When you are done selecting groups click "Add to Groups".
    *   If you’re working with multiple groups of learners, you can customize what each group works on through this function.
    *   To review the Projects you’ve selected, go to your Group’s page by clicking on the group button at the top of the page.

Help: Projects
==============

### Getting Started: Finding the right Projects

Mouse Create has 100+ projects across 30+ competency areas. To help you find the right projects for your group, we recommend these steps:

*   Take the Mouse Educator Course: Select the “Projects" button in the top menu. Then, within the Project Finder, select the “Educator Course". Then complete each project within the course.
*   Use the Project Finder (in the “Projects" area) to navigate to course pages about each Mouse Create course, or to filter the projects by skill or setting tags.
*   On a course page, you can explore the outcomes, materials and instruction time requirements for each course, as well as the digital badges earned within, the projects for the course in order and a list of optional, related projects.
*   To add an entire course to your group’s playlist, click the “Add Course to Playlist” button at the top of the page. 
*   All projects are listed on [this spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1tpFh32ZsngoccuSEEjZyI_4xu3_v6Ocvk_WgY9L35FY/edit#gid=236506175), along with their Chromebook and iPad compatibility.

### Preparing to Facilitate a Project

*   Projects that require facilitation are often tagged “Group Only"—meaning this project can not be done by a student on their own.
*   To facilitate a project on Mouse Create, first open it by clicking on the project from the Project Finder or within your Group’s Playlist.
*   Before leading it, read through the Plan tab to find a list of outcomes, materials, and instructions on how to prep the activity. In this tab you will also find a link to the project’s standards alignment, debrief/reflection questions, and any suggested prerequisite or follow-up projects.
*   We recommend going through each of the project’s steps on your own before leading with youth.

### Working on a Project

Your browser does not support HTML5.

##### The video above shows an older version of the project interface. "Project Background" is now called "Plan" and is in a tab at the top of the project. "Review & Submit" is now called "Submit Work" and is also in a tab at the top of the project.

*   Students, or small groups of students, can either follow along step-by-step on their own devices or you can display the steps on a projector or smartboard for the whole group.
*   Show your Work: On each step, there is a “Requirements" area at the bottom. This area often has required reflection questions, or a request to document their work with an image or text. If youth want to upload or submit work on a step that does not have a Requirements area they can do so at any time from the "Submit Work" tab.
*   Submit Work: At the end of each project, students must review and submit their work to receive credit for having completed the project.
*   Creators: If students are working in teams, or as a whole group, they can tag other users in your group as “collaborators" before submitting the project. This will give those users credit for having completed the project as well.
*   Submitted projects need to be reviewed by the group educator. You can find these projects on your group page in the “Group Work" tab.
*   Note: students in multiple groups need to make sure the correct group is active at the top of the page before starting a project. If a student wants to submit a project do a different group they will need to switch groups by going to the “My Groups" page from the “More" menu.

### Students: Viewing & Commenting Project Work submitted by others

Your browser does not support HTML5.

*   To find a user’s Project Work, go to your Group home Members tab.
*   Click on a name in the list to go to their Profile.
*   Scroll to the bottom of the Profile to get to the “Recent Work Log”. All project work created by this user will appear in this area.
*   Click on the Project’s name to open the user’s Project Work window.
*   There are 2 tabs in this window: Project Work & Discussion.
*   The Project Work tab has all of the text, images or attachments submitted by the user. The Discussion tab is where you can leave comments or start a discussion.
*   When leaving a comment, you can choose to attach a star icon (to share something you like about the work), a question mark icon (to ask a question), a lightbulb icon (to share an idea or suggestion about the work) or just leave a comment without an icon.
*   You will receive a notification if another user replies to your comment, or if another user leaves a comment on your own Project Work.

### Editing or Deleting Comments

*   To edit your own comment or reply, click the edit button at the end of your message text.
*   Click “Submit” or press the enter/return key to save your edited message.
*   To delete your own comment or reply, click the delete button at the end of your message text.
*   If you notice an inappropriate comment from another user:
    *   Leave a reply with feedback about why you think it is inappropriate, asking them to edit
    *   Speak to the user in person (if they are in your group) and ask them to remove or edit their comment
    *   Educators: if it is not possible to resolve through feedback directly with the user who submitted the comment, if the user is in your group, you can edit their password from the Manage Members link on the Group Page and log in with their account to delete the comment.

### Educators Only: Reviewing Projects & Leaving Feedback

Your browser does not support HTML5.

*   You will receive a notification when your group members have finished a project.
*   You can click the message from the Notifications Area to review the work and leave feedback there.
*   You can also view all submitted work from your group members on your Group page under the Playlist—in the Project Review area.
*   Click on the project name to open a window that will show all of the submitted work.
*   Click the Discussion Tab to leave feedback for the project creator/s or to monitor their discussion. Your comments will send out a notification to each of the project creators (each student who collaborated on it).
*   If you are satisfied with their work, go back to the “Project Work” tab, scroll to the bottom and check the “Mark as Reviewed" box and close the window.
*   This will send a notification to each creator of the project (the student who submitted the project and all collaborators)

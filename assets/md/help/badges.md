### About the Badges Table

The badges table is used by Educators to view pending badges and award badges to members of their group. Student accounts can also view the badge table, but instead of the Award Badge" buttons they will just see that the badge has not been awarded.

### Educators: How to Award Badges

Educator must review each project related to the badge within the Group Work tab before the badge can be awarded in the Badges tab.

1.  Go to the Group Work tab in the Group area of Mouse Create.
2.  Make sure you have reviewed every project related to the badge for each student. [More on reviewing project work](/help/group-work).
3.  When all projects related to the badge have been reviewed, the badge will appear in the Badges tab within the Group area, waiting to be awarded by the educator.
4.  Select the red “Award Badge" button next to the badge to issue it to the student.
5.  Awarded badges will appear on the student’s [Mouse Create Profile page](https://create.mouse.org/profile) and on their credly.com account after they log in to accept it.

### Educators: Choosing Projects with Badges

Every [course](/course-directory) on Mouse Create has at least 1 badge associated with it. For example, if your group has added the Serious Games course to your Playlist, your students will become eligible for 3 digital badges as they complete each project within the course: Game Designer, Scratch Developer and Scratch Activist. A few badges have required projects that span over 2 related courses, for example the Apps & Software badge relates to projects in both the IT Essentials course and the IT Admin course.

The [Badge Directory](/badge-directory) lists every available badge on Mouse Create and which specific projects must be submitted and reviewed to earn that badge, but we recommend that groups select full courses for their playlist, as courses organize the projects into a recommended pedagogical order. Go to the [Course Directory](/course-directory) to learn more.

When projects associated with a badge are added to a group’s playlist the badge image will display on the project card in the playlist. [More on how to use your group’s playlist.](/playlist)

Once you’ve earned a digital badge on Mouse Create, you can go to [Credly](https://credly.com/) to share it publicly on college and job applications, on social networks and with your school. When your educator awards you a new badge, you will receive an email from credly.com to claim your badge through their website.

More info is available on [Credly’s Knowledge Base](http://support.credly.com/knowledgebase/articles/1147588-how-can-i-share-embed-and-download-my-badge).

### Badges for Students under 13

Mouse has created a series of [printable Badge Certificates](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0B15rEunHuSkxM2gwMFVVZXZVdWs?usp=sharing) for groups working with students under 13. However, once a student turns 13, they will automatically be able to earn digital badges by following the instructions above. Work submitted by students before they are 13 will count toward future digital badges.

### Badges for Members of Multiple Groups

Because Mouse Create allows users to create and join multiple groups on the site, it is important to make sure that you are are submitted your project work within the right group. If you or your group members are in multiple groups, here are a few things to keep in mind:

*   If a group member earned a badge in a different group, the badge will not appear in the Badges table in your group, even if they submit all of the associated projects to your group as well.
*   If a group member submits projects associated with a badge to more than one group, the badge will only appear in the badge table of one of the groups. The badge will appear in the group where the final project submission for the badge was reviewed. Only the educator in the group will be able to issue the badge.

### Badges for Returning Students

Because Mouse issues badges through Credly each badge can only be earned once by each user. However, if the user submits new work for projects related to a badge that has already been earned, the new work will be added to the badge’s public page.

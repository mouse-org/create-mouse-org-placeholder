# Issue: Educators unable to change student passwords

Mouse Create is currently experiencing an issue where Educators are not able to update the passwords of students in their group if the student has set an email address. We are working quickly to resolve the issue.

A work around is: If the educator clears the email field while updating a student password, the new password will be saved, and the email will be preserved. We are working to restore the intended functionality ASAP! Thank you for your patience!
